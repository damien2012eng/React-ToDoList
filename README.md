# ReactJS Mini-project: Damien's ToDoList

## Inspired by the Youtuber Dev Ed. 

Tasks can be labelled as either Completed or Uncomplete. For each todo option, the green button can toggle the todo to be complete or uncomplete. While the red button is designed
to delete the todo. The dropdown menu will give users to select completed, uncompleted or all tasks to display. Furthermore, all the todo data are saved in the localstorage. Therefore, refreshing the webpage will not delete stored data.
